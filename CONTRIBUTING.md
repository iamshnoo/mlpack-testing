Since this is more of a personal repository, I don't really expect anyone to contribute.<br>
But, contributions are always welcome :)

- Any feedback, suggestion or code snippet that can help me speed up my progress 
can be a contribution.

- Any minor improvements to the features to improve readability can be a contribution.

- If you manage to find any major bugs, please do report it immediately as an issue
in the original repository if these features have been merged. If not, you can create an issue
here directly and that will be very helpful for me.
